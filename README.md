# GNNDepthAnalysis

In this work, we present an end-to-end framework for optimal depth analysis, that allows
us to label nodes by their depth utilization and to characterize the different label
groups through multiple hypotheses over their centrality measures.

The following notebooks reproduce our work:  
train_models.ipynb to train a model using our framework.  
nodes_permutation_tests.ipynb for hypothesis testing of the optimal depth over each node the graph.  
centrality_scores_analysis.ipynb for hypothesis testing over the optimal depths.
